ABSTRACT:

In this report are shown and explained the fundamental concepts that led to the idea for a soft material security valve. The aim of the element is to prevent the depressurization of a hydraulic system as a result of a damage to a circuit section. The analysis starts with feasibility evaluation with approximated structural and hydraulic models and then is deepened with valve mechanical design and FEM load and fluidic simulations. The fabrication procedure is also described, explaining the design of the mold for the valve fabrication by silicone injection.
